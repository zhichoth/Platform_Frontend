## About
YSEC is an all-round platform and offers solutions for token / ether and liquidity locking as well as adding liquidity on Uniswap. Besides those tokenomic solutions we will also launch presales added by the developers creating them. This is a fully automated process and YSEC will never own any of the assets locked within our smart contract. YSEC is  a fully transparent platform as well, where investors will be able to see when and which projects are having their presale as well as how their tokenomics are organized.

In addition, we will have a YSEC – YSEC staking pool up, and there will be more staking pools in the future. Token holders will be able to stake their YSEC for some time, with the option to withdraw early and get a nice APY in return.

We also have a YSEC – ETH staking pool. We believe this is our most bullish tokenomic where tokenholders can grab a piece of the fees generated through developers using our platform.


##Pool
###YSEC – YSEC staking
We are partnered with Ferrum Network for their farming / staking technology and are still discussing on how to optimize APY within these staking pools and in what ways we can make it most interesting for our tokenholders to participate.

Within these pools participators stake their YSEC to earn a little more in return by the time they decide to withdraw. We currently (01-22-21) have a pool running with an APY of 60%. We will release more YSEC – YSEC staking pools in the future.

###YSEC – ETH staking
The most interesting part of our platform for tokenholders, is the YSEC – ETH staking pool our platform will provide. A standard tokenomic within the pre-sales launching on our platform, will be a 5% base fee in ether raised. Half of this will be used to continue developing the platform. The other half however will be added to the dividend pool where YSEC stakers will be rewarded in ETH.

To give an insight into what this might mean for YSEC tokenholders, we used the data from a platform we are aiming to be a direct competitor of: Bounce. Using the total amount of ETH that came through Bounce in the past few months, we can calculate the earnings our staking pool would divide if the YSEC platform is going to be used in the same frequency.

Looking at Bloxy we see the following info: A total of 628.318 ETH has been transferred to developers using Bounce as their pre-sale platform. When translated to the YSEC platform that would mean 15.708 ETH would have been added to our YSEC - ETH dividend pool, representing a total value of 19.5 million USD in a time period of just 3 months (looking at value on 01-22-21).

Our dividend pool is a bullish tokenomic and is integrated to use our community as a marketing catalyst. The more projects decide to launch through YSEC, the more ETH will be added to our dividend pool.

Because our community is rewarded for presales launched through YSEC, it will, in turn, make sure there will be a lot of exposure. Why? Because the more exposure, the more projects will launch trough YSEC and the more our tokenholders will earn.
